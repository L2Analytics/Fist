# F# Importance Sampling Toolkit


# Todo

## Misc
* Probably need a way to limit the number of samples used in some scenarios
    * Some computations using the posterior seemed to be taking a longtime--the reason turned out to be that I had used a time based stopping rule
       and the sampler actually generated way more samples than expected (~500,000)...so, e.g., predictions were being generated by iterating over that entire array for every prediction. 


## Urgent


## General Bayesian
* Model Averaging
* Posterior diagnostics
* Sampling
    * Parallelization

## General Model Functionality
* Cross-validation
* Bootstrapping

# Notes

* ParStream doesn't have a takeWhile, so parallelization will require slight rework of stopping function
