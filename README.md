# F# Importance Sampling Toolkit


# Todo

## Urgent
* Updated IS implementation doesn't have a great way of normalizing the weights.


## General Bayesian
* Model Averaging
* Posterior diagnostics
* Sampling
    * Parallelization

## General Model Functionality
* Deviance-based performance
* Cross-validation
* Bootstrapping

# Notes

* ParStream doesn't have a takeWhile, so parallelization will require slight rework of stopping function
